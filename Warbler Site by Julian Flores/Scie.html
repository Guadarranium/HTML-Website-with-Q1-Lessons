            <p class="article-content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the words of Silaynon jeepney driver Arman Leocario following the controversies surrounding the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program’s (PUVMP) franchise consolidation deadline, April 30, 2024.
                “Colorum nalang eh, galing indi man kami gihapon ka biyahe colorum kay kung dakpon kami, lisensya man gihapon namon ang kuhaon samon.  Kami man gihapon ang maapektuhan. (We’ll be declared colorum. However, we still could not operate since we will be apprehended by the law and our license is at stake. We are still the ones affected),” Leocario added. 
                Another jeepney driver, Rey Balogo, shared his sentiments, saying that if PUVMP pushes through, many drivers will be jobless, stressing that it is the only thing supporting their children’s education.
                “Kung magdayon man gid, dako gid ang epekto sa mga driver. Magutman gid kami (If it will proceed, it will leave a huge impact on us drivers. We will surely starve),” Balogo continued.

                <b>Franchise fiasco</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), unconsolidated jeepneys that will continue their routes after the April 30 deadline will be given a ‘leeway’ until mid-May, but they will be fined and impounded should they continue after initial warnings. 
                “We will tell them to stop operating and issue them show cause orders. But despite all of this, and if they continue, it will be the Philippine National Police (PNP), in partnership with the LTFRB, who will implement the law. We will then impound them,” LTFRB Chairperson Teofilo Guadiz III stated.
                Guadiz, in his interview, said, “It’s well within their right to keep their livelihood by operating. But it is also the right of the state to implement the law.”
                Department of Transportation (DOTr) Undersecretary Ferdinand Ortega echoed the viewpoint, highlighting that the LTFRB will give ‘due process’ to the cooperatives and corporations that have lapsed the deadline.
                “Technically, colorum na sila but as a process by the law, pagpapaliwanagin muna namin sila. After one week po, magpapalabas na rin kami ng utos na ‘yung mga hindi nakapagpaliwanag or hindi katanggap-tanggap ang paliwanag ay maaari na po naming hulihin… Ang penalty po niyan ay one-year suspension sa driver, at P50,000 ang multa naman doon sa sasakyang mai-impound po namin,” Ortega noted.

                <b>Commuters’ conundrum</b>
                <br>
                <br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this issue amassed hundreds of opinions from Filipino commuters, Montserratian students like June Arvin Bebit, who rides a jeepney daily, said the implementation of the PUVMP ‘has both positive and negative effects’ as it will help eradicate traditional jeepneys that are considered to be ‘one of the lead contributors of greenhouse gasses leading to environmental problems.’
                “However, as a student, it will also affect me [the modernization program] because the jeepney fare will surely increase due to drivers being indebted to upgrade their jeepneys instantly,” the Grade 12 student added.
                Grade 10 student Juliana Therese Guacena also acknowledged that 
                “jeepney drivers who cannot afford to purchase a modern jeepney would not only lose their source of income but would also be incapable of supporting their family’s daily needs.”
