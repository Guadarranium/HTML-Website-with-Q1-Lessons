            <p class="article">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental disruptions begin to occur as the dim haze of global warming and temperature changes descend upon Antarctica. 
                According to data from NASA's Earth Observatory, the temperature of Antarctica has risen by more than 2.5Â°C over the past 50 years, with some regions enduring an even more pronounced warming, causing severe melting of the Arctic ice over the past few years due to the weakening grip of Antarctica.
                Consequently, the continent now suffers. Sea levels are rising, ocean currents are changing, and glaciers are melting quickly.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath this Arctic wonder is a place that houses almost 235 species of land and marine animals, ranging from gigantic whales to the most unique species of wildlife that the world could ever see.
                These animals depend on steady sea ice for mating and hunting. Unfortunately, their habitat and food supply are shrinking due to the extreme glacial loss. This enormous threat results in severe destruction of the animal's habitat, which forces them to become smaller, leading to starvation and death.
                Undoubtedly, if these problems continue to arise, there is a huge possibility that the rarest and most delicate species the world has ever seen will no longer exist in humans' eyes.

                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most terrifying effects of global warming is the accelerated melting of Antarctica's glacial ice. Roughly 25% of the rise in global sea levels can be attributed to the continent's average annual loss of 252 billion tons of ice since the 1990s. 
                This ice loss affects the local ecosystems and wildlife and increases the risk of flooding and eviction for low-lying areas across the globe. Scientists predict that if this trend continues, coastal cities like Los Angeles, Venice, and New York may experience frequent flooding by the end of the century.

                <b>Rising sea levels</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global sea levels and climate patterns are significantly affected by the melting of Antarctica's ice due to extensive glacial loss over the past few years. 
                Rising sea levels have the most obvious impact, threatening hundreds of millions of people living along the coastlines. 
                Meanwhile, the risk of flooding, erosion, storm surges, and saltwater intrusion may also increase with even a few centimeters of sea level rise, damaging farms, homes, and infrastructure. 
                According to a 2020 study, a one-meter increase in the global mean sea level by 2100 meters will result in a two- to three-order increase in annual flood damages, which could account for up to 20.3% of the world's GDP. We cannot completely rule out a two-meter global mean sea level increase by the year 2100, so this can never be underestimated.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bridging the gaps that concern the sufficient loss of the Arctic region is essential; perhaps this time, government officials and scientists won't be the only ones to cooperate; people across the globe should help, too.
                "It is crucial to increase public awareness, instruct others, and support laws that aid in the adaptation and mitigation of climate change," urges the WEF. 
                Each of us is responsible for adopting environmentally friendly habits, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and supporting conservation efforts. 
                Together, we can ensure a sustainable future for Antarctica and the world. Let's join hands and advocate for collective action before it's too late.
                We, humans, will perpetually cause permanent damage to our planet and the  extinction of priceless species if we do not act immediately. Together, let's advocate combined efforts to combat climate change, preserve Antarctica's distinctive ecosystems, and ensure future generations have a sustainable future. By working together, we can ensure that Antarctica and the world have a sustainable future.
