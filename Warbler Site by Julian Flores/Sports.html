            <p class="article">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreams are chased, records are broken—a remarkable story of consistent training to bring home the bacon as the team sacrificed everything.
                Soar high DepEd Silay as Team Monsai took home multiple medals in the Secondary Athletics competition during the Provincial Meet 2024 at the Panaad Park and Stadium, Bacolod City, April 4–5. Indeed, hard work paid off as they brought glory to the city and the school. 
                The remarkable accomplishment that has caught the attention of many was made possible by a coach who, despite being a newcomer, exemplifies that the path to triumph is not without obstacles. This inspiring individual is Mr. John Kenaz Moreno.
                “This is a well-deserved win. It is the fruit of your hard work, sacrifices, and dedication,” Sir Ken said when asked about his message to his athlete. 
                “It is also an answer to what we have been praying for so long. Your success belongs not only to you but to everyone who has supported you,” he added.
                Despite being new to the coaching scene, Sir Ken proved his leadership, guiding his student-athletes with flying colors and with unwavering dedication to his athletes’ well-being and growth. 
                “As a coach, I constantly remind myself that my athletes are humans and not machines. They also feel and grow. They are also teenagers who need proper guidance and a role model,” Sir Ken declared firmly. 
                Rather than succumbing to the pressures of competition, Sir Ken fosters an environment of camaraderie and mutual support where each athlete feels valued and motivated to excel.
                Sir Ken doesn’t “push” his athletes so they can go beyond their limits, and he doesn’t want to pressure them. 
                “I ‘nudge or poke’ them to motivate them so that they can do better and more, constantly reminding them of our goals,” Sir Ken affirmed.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his guidance, Gian Magbanua achieved an extraordinary feat for Triple Jump Athletics Secondary Girls, seizing the gold and surpassing even the Palarong Pambansa 2023 winner. Additionally, Magbanua captured silver for the Long Jump Secondary Girls, demonstrating her skills on the field.
                “Gapasalamat ko sa coach ko nga si sir Ken tungod sa iya bulig nag improve mga skills ko kag performance,” she stated with awe, recognizing all the things in her achievement.
                Magbanua beamed with pride as she praised her team’s effort to represent their school and city. “Ari lang ko di pirme sa inyo suportahan takamo pareho sa pag support nyo sakon kada hampang ko be humble lang ta pirme,” she stated proudly. 
                For jumpers, Nash Mangahas and Angelo Verano, who snagged the silver and bronze medals, respectively, in the Athletics Secondary Boys Pole Vault, having a new coach in Sir Ken was never a challenge but a blessing in disguise. 
                “Gapa thank you ko sa hard work ka coaches and trainers namon nga nag pangabudlay and nag sakripisyo ka oras nila para mapa bakod ko and kami,” said Mangahas, reflecting on their success. 
                Similarly, Verano thanked God and their support team for their remarkable achievement despite being a first-timer, “Happy ko kay naka place ko not bad for the first-timer.”
                Sir Ken and his team’s journey is marked by unwavering determination and relentless effort to achieve their objectives. Their accomplishments, no matter how big or small, are a testament to their perseverance and steadfast commitment to their goals. 
                They have indeed embodied the spirit of our school’s motto, 
                
                “TATAK MONTSERRATIAN, TATAK KAMPEON!”*
