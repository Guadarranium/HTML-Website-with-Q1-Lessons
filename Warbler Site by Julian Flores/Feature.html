            <p class="article">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conquering shrubbery grew from the head of the ruined house—a heap succeeded by the wilds that preceded it. It was stripped of the lively vibrancy that echoed its residence. 
                Down the street were hanging wires, passed frequently by smoke belchers; gone were the women with pañuelos, fabric furled on their shoulders like wings, opening their windows. 
                Across the street was a modern "eyesore" of a bank with concrete and sharp corners that cut the hems of the citizen's ancestry.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window in and out of the past has shut permanently, and the whispers of predecessors and Castilian struggle shunted similarly. What remains is an afterimage.
                The future seems bleak for the site's sights.
                "Silay is still beautiful," a woman opposed, the words flowing smoothly as the winds traverse through a meadow—an outsider looking in.
                "Palangga ko man' ni," (I love it, too), the tour guide's words poised like the proud sampaguitas on the bush, carrying the charm of enthusiasm. "Nothing stops us from being true to our panubli-on."

                <b>An insider's hand</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Warbler interview, Heritage Advocate and Negros Occidental Historical Council Chairman Neil Solomon "Solo" Locsin said that culture was a proponent rather than a detriment to Silay City's progress.
                As a Silay Councilor, he passed the Silay Heritage Code, ensuring a strict anti-demolition program and protection and preservation of ancestral houses in the "Silay City Heritage Zone." The zone, alongside other business zones, was designated by Silay's Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP).
                Trailing the city's Calle Real, Rizal Street is a corridor into its heritage—the commercial infrastructure on the wayside parallels classical architecture. With Jollibee and foreign franchise McDonalds staying close to the town's roots, businesses are holding hands with local initiatives.
                For the abandoned ancestral homes within the zone, businesses could stakeholding, obligated to perform adaptive reuse practices that don't destroy the architecture; instead, it integrates the classical antique in their enterprise: German Unson House and Casa Gamboa revived through its business affairs.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steady streams of tourists exit the doors of the Bacolod-Silay Airport. For some, the quaint town is a transportation junction, while for others, it's a destination for not the Philippine tourist staple of luxury and golden shore sands but the stroke of culture resting well on its lands.
                Cultural Tourism is one of the city's most significant economic prospects, drawing people to its heart—its heritage zone. It's a matter of time, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) decision, before streams turn into rivers.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silay City Heritage Zone is nominated in UNESCO's tentative list for its cultural landscape and sugar heritage.
                Where UNESCO marks a point, feature, or structure in a place, they recognize the unique beacon of preservation in the city, no heritage home left unnoticed.

                <b>Rivers of investments</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite government initiatives pushing for conservation, it doesn't inhibit the area's economy.
                Silay City is experiencing high economic dynamism, sprouting small and medium enterprises and more than Php100 investments.
                Major industries exist in the city, such as Fuji Pipes, a major distributor of piping systems in the region, Hawaiian-Philippine Company (HPCO), the highest taxpayer in Silay, and the inaugurated solar farm. Still, expansion of businesses is expected, especially real estate.
                Businesses like Robinson's and the Philippines' largest store chain, SM, are patiently waiting for the right moment to landbank significant investments into the city's reach.

                Sir Solo hammered into the internal problem of the anti-progress notion when it comes to cultural preservation, saying that Silaynons are fortunate to have cultural assets that other towns lack records of. It enables the city to grow economically, and if the citizens are of a different mind, then the city's progress would encounter difficulty.
                He also mentioned that the unstable electrical power experienced in Silay doesn't allow enterprises to flourish. Climate change, too, plays a part in making natural conditions dangerous to the city's heritage structures.
                Yet despite these issues, support comes from both the government and locals.
                The National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP), for instance, is giving Php5.5 million for the renovation of the Angel Araneta Ledesma House, serving as Silay's Cultural Division Office; the city is within the spotlight of the national government and agencies' watch.
                Furthermore, Doña Montserrat Lopez Memorial High School's (DMLMHS) Special Program in the Arts (SPA) artistic expressions conserve the areas through paint, dance, and lyric panubli-on.
                Silay City's preservation doesn't hamper progress, nor does modernity pave over culture. The city prospers.
                The inheritance of cultural assets in Silay is integral to its economy and character. In the words of Sir Solo, "preserve it, conserve it, and be proud of it."
